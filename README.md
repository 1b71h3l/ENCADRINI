# ENCADRINI
Our project 'ENCADRINI': is a conceptual proposal and implementation of a web application for project management, which will be used by multiple stakeholders and provide several benefits. With the aim of reducing administrative tasks and allowing teams to focus on high-value tasks, our 'ENCADRINI' application offers an information system for automating the management of final year and multidisciplinary projects for students at the  Higher School of computer science Sidi Bel Abbes. This system will streamline the process for its various stakeholders.
